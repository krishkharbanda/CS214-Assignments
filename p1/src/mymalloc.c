/**
 * CS 214: Systems Programming, Fall 2025
 * Project 1: My Little Malloc
 *
 * mymalloc.c - A custom memory allocator implementation.
 *
 * This library provides a custom version of malloc() and free() that manages a
 * fixed-size heap. It includes error detection for common memory issues like
 * freeing invalid pointers, double-freeing, and reports memory leaks upon exit.
 *
 * The heap is managed as a contiguous block of memory, partitioned into chunks.
 * Each chunk has a metadata header followed by a payload for user data.
 * A first-fit algorithm is used for allocation, and adjacent free blocks
 * are coalesced upon deallocation.
